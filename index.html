    <h3>Developing Intelligent Tangible Interfaces for an Affordable Early Programming Education</h3>

    <div class="section">

        <img class="doc" src="media/PhD_Qual_(1).jpg">
        <p> This research is conducted in Intelligent User Interfaces Lab at Koç University - Is Bank AI Center, and supported by TUBITAK.

    <h3>Our Contribution</h3>
    <p class="info"><span><i>You can find all our open-source material at our <a href="https://karton.ku.edu.tr/">official project website.</a></i></span></p>

    <div class="section">
        <img class="doc" src="media/PhD_Qual_(2).jpg">
        <p>Our research is at the intersection of human-computer interaction, learning technologies, and computer science education. It aims to develop affordable and accessible intelligent tangible interfaces for primary and middle school programming education.
            We developed two different programming interfaces for the early years of education, conducted several field studies, and develop more than a hundred tutorials to accelerate the research and development in the field. The design philosophy of
            our tools is using readily available resources to increase the affordability of programming education activities in low-income communities.

    <h3>A Brief Background - Start</h3>


    <div class="section">
        <img class="doc" src="media/PhD_Qual_(3).jpg">
        <p>
            Before diving into details, let’s give a brief background on teaching programming.
        </p>

    </div>

    <h3>Drag and Drop Web Programming</h3>


    <div class="section">
        <img class="doc" src="media/PhD_Qual_(4).jpg">
        <p>Today, most curricula integrate activities with drag and drop web programming environments. The error-free syntax and visual programming blocks ease the development process for a novice student. In the figure, you can see Scratch, one of the most
            popular programming environment that uses this interaction.
        </p>

    </div>

    <h3>Tangible Programming</h3>


    <div class="section">
        <img class="doc" src="media/PhD_Qual_(5).jpg">
        <p>Integrating physical interaction in programming interfaces was always popular. Using tangible materials in the classroom supports collaborative learning and active discussion. The first example was Seymour Papert’s LOGO language and its robotic
            companion ‘turtle’. Papert’s vision encouraged researchers and teachers to develop new products for integrating programming in primary and middle schools as it is also positively affecting students’ STEM-related skills. Starting with this
            turtle robot, here, you see a few examples that use designerly created tangible blocks to code some pre-defined moves in games or robotic coding. Although these tools support the advantages of having hands-on interaction, their hard-coded
            design decisions limit the extendibility of the programming environment and constrain the group activities.

        </p>

    </div>

    <h3>Unplugged Activities</h3>


    <div class="section">
        <img class="doc" src="media/PhD_Qual_(6).jpg">
        <p>Another approach is teaching the fundamentals of algorithmic thinking via physical activities that do not require any computer. It is called unplugged activities.
        </p>

    </div>


    <h3>The Challenge</h3>


    <div class="section">
        <img class="doc" src="media/PhD_Qual_(7).jpg">
        <p>Although programming education has become a mandatory part of the curriculum in most countries, these web-based and tangible tools are still not accessible by most students due to their high prices and limited infrastructure of schools. Using
            already in-use mobile phones in the classroom can benefit disadvantaged students to grasp the fundamentals of programming.
        </p>

    </div>

    <h3>Research Contributions</h3>


    <div class="section">
        <img class="doc" src="media/PhD_Qual_(8).jpg">
        <p>Our research addresses these limitations by offering a way to integrate everyday materials as tangible programming blocks to increase the affordability and collaboration in programming activities only using a few smartphones. In this research,
            we aimed to solve three main challenges. We developed an age-appropriate product that shows the right level of abstraction for a novice user and shows extendibility for more advanced users. We aimed to increase engagement and collaboration
            in the classroom with design and field studies. Finally, we transfer our knowledge and experience to use the same interaction techniques in a more advanced programming subject.

    <h3>Kart-ON</h3>

    <p class="info"><span><i>Paper submitted to EICS'22. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yUnybY0wvZH9uXmJzJ-8u9wf0G8-WMwZ/view?usp=sharing"> Read the manuscript.</a></i></span></p>

    <div class="section">
        <img class="doc" src="media/PhD_Qual_(9).jpg">
        <p>Kart-ON allows students to design their own tangible programming blocks using cheap everyday materials. It can be paper, markers, play-dough, tennis ball, and other cheap materials. Here, you can see the main flow of using Kart-ON. While using
            Kart-ON, students first create programs using pre-defined programming cards and tangible objects. Then, these programs are recognized by the computer vision-powered mobile application and passed to an interpreter. Finally, the interpreter
            result is rendered to visual outputs on mobile WebView. If the user wants to store the function using an everyday object, here, for example, it is a tennis ball, they can use our interface to take a few shots and use the object as a programming
            block.
        </p>

    </div>

    <h3>Main Screens</h3>


    <div class="section">
        <img class="doc" src="media/PhD_Qual_(10).jpg">
        <p>Here, I shared the screenshots of the main screens of Kart-ON. Let’s take a look at them one by one.
        </p>

    </div>

    <h3>Kart-ON: Home Page</h3>


    <div class="section">
        <img class="doc" src="media/PhD_Qual_(11).jpg">
        <p>When students open the application, they first see a set of activities that are aligned with our national programming curriculum. They can interactively read and play these contents. The navigation bar is on the left, which is the most suitable
            position to easily navigate with their developing motor skills.
        </p>

    </div>

    <h3>Kart-ON: Program List</h3>


    <div class="section">
        <img class="doc" src="media/PhD_Qual_(12).jpg">
        <p>Using the coding button on the bar, they can see previously created programs or sample applications. Here, you can also see the group behavior, which we added for quick transition between classroom group activities. Teachers can jump between groups
            using the “group” code block.
        </p>

    </div>

    <h3>Kart-ON: Adding Commands</h3>


    <div class="section">
        <img class="doc" src="media/PhD_Qual_(13).jpg">
        <p>When a user clicks on creating a new program button, a camera screen opens and recognizes pre-defined coding blocks. These coding blocks allow students to create drawings and animations. Students can scan these blocks one by one or multiple at
            once.
        </p>

    </div>

    <h3>Kart-ON: Program Output</h3>


    <div class="section">
        <img class="doc" src="media/PhD_Qual_(14).jpg">
        <p>
            When they click on the complete program button, they see the resulted application on canvas.

        </p>

    </div>

    <h3>Kart-ON: Saving the Program</h3>


    <div class="section">
        <img class="doc" src="media/PhD_Qual_(15).jpg">
        <p>
            Students can either save their program using text or use our transfer learning interface to assign a physical object to represent this function.

        </p>

    </div>

    <h3>Kart-ON: Transfer Learning Module</h3>


    <div class="section">
        <img class="doc" src="media/PhD_Qual_(16).jpg">
        <p>
            If they choose to use transfer learning, they can train the network using a few examples. Then test if the recognition occurs as they want.
        </p>

    </div>

    <h3>Kart-ON: Saved Program</h3>


    <div class="section">
        <img class="doc" src="media/PhD_Qual_(17).jpg">
        <p>
            When training is completed, they can see the program is saved with the given object. Now, we can use this object to add the assigned code blocks to a new program.

        </p>

    </div>

    <h3>Tangible Data Programming (Flow)</h3>

    <p class="info"><span><i>Paper published in IEEE Vis'22 Workshop: VisActivities. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.05303.pdf"> Read the paper.</a></i></span></p>

    <div class="section">
        <img class="doc" src="media/PhD_Qual_(18).jpg">
        <p>In the next step, we transferred our knowledge and expertise gained by developing and conducting user studies with Kart-ON to another important educational subject which is data science. Here, you can see one possible workflow of our programming
            environment that involves programming cards and shared tablets. In this organization, students first answer questions with the given programming cards, then use our mobile interface to add programming cards to their data pipeline.

        </p>

    </div>

    <h3>Martı Programming Cards</h3>


    <div class="section">
        <img class="doc" src="media/PhD_Qual_(19).jpg">
        <p>These physical programming cards consist of twenty-seven functions that can manipulate and visualize data. The cards allow students to spend a substantial portion of their time in activities that don’t require a computer or a tablet. Using the
            physical cards, students construct data visualization pipelines while engaging in discussion.
        </p>

    </div>

    <h3>Martı Web and Mobile Applications</h3>


    <div class="section">
        <img class="doc" src="media/PhD_Qual_(20).jpg">
        <p>Using our web and mobile interfaces, students can complete activities in different modalities. Similar to the Kart-ON mobile application can recognize the programming blocks and easily add blocks to student’s digital programming pipelines. We
            originally developed this web environment to support easy simulation and test of programming activities by teachers, however, it becomes a very usable environment as it shares drag-and-drop functionality with popular programming environments.
            So, currently, many students and teachers use this environment to introduce data programming in middle schools.
        </p>

    </div>

    <h3>Example Program with Marti</h3>


    <div class="section">
        <img class="doc" src="media/PhD_Qual_(21).jpg">
        <p>
            Here, in this example program, students choose these four cards to place markers on the world map for each football player that is older than thirty years old.
        </p>

    </div>

    <h3>Contribution Summary</h3>


    <div class="section">
        <img class="doc" src="media/PhD_Qual_(22).jpg">
        <p>Until now, we discussed the final applications of our research. However, these applications were developed with continuous updates from the field studies where we closely worked with students and teachers. In these studies, we become design partners
            with 9 to 12-year-old students who learned the programming concepts for the first time So, I would like to share our carefully designed studies.
        </p>

    </div>

    <h3>Design Activity-1:Interactive Story</h3>

    <p class="info"><span><i>We summarized all design studies in one paper and submitted to CHI'22. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/11CnDurjp0L2BLi7rdMNf5l8EYy-T3nFa/view?usp=sharing"> Read the manuscript.</a></i></span></p>


    <div class="section">
        <img class="doc" src="media/PhD_Qual_(23).jpg">
        <p>In the interactive story activity, students created tangible objects to modal algorithmic elements in their stories. We provided various available materials and focused on students’ material selection. At the end of the workshop, we observed that
            children at this age can easily combine different materials and build abstract representations of algorithmic structures such as branching. However, they really need guidance on collaboration, especially when there is a limited amount of material.
        </p>

    </div>

    <h3>Design Activity-2: Programming Language </h3>


    <div class="section">
        <img class="doc" src="media/PhD_Qual_(24).jpg">
        <p>In the second design activity, we become design partners with children. We prototyped a high-level programming language with students who have limited experience in programming. The domain of our language can be cooking, playing tennis, or controlling
            a robot. We decompose these domains into subproblems so that we can structure them as programming commands. For example, a sub-problem of gardening activity can be watering the garden. We designed physical artifacts for commands, inputs, and
            outputs to use our programming languages. Our observations in this activity revealed the need to explore more about the interpretability and memorability of self-designed programming objects. After five minutes of creating a tangible object,
            children could forget what it was supposed to be in some situations. To this end, we tested the self- and inter-memorability and interpretability of the programming objects. Here, in the object analysis part, you see that how building abstract
            shapes and focusing on objects rather than the command itself decreases the interpretability of the programming object.

        </p>

    </div>

    <h3>Design Activity-3: Flappy Bird</h3>


    <div class="section">
        <img class="doc" src="media/PhD_Qual_(25).jpg">
        <p>In the third workshop, children created a new high-level programming interface with tangible blocks for Flappy Bird Game. We designed a new programming interface to conduct this workshop to allow children to add their self-made tangibles into
            the coding environment. In this environment, they can use their tangible commands to program the Flappy Bird game. We utilized “Teachable Machine”, a web platform that eases the creation of AI-powered products with image, sound, and pose classification
            models.
        </p>

    </div>

    <h3>User Studies</h3>


    <div class="section">
        <img class="doc" src="media/PhD_Qual_(26).jpg">
        <p>To assess the usability, engagement, and collaboration both quantitatively and qualitatively, we conducted field studies in different environments. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, we only conducted one group activity, the rest of the studies were
            conducted individually. In all our meetings, we followed a similar programming activity. First, we gave definitions of fundamental terms like programming and algorithm. Then, we introduced some real-life examples in an algorithmic structure,
            such as making a sandwich step by step. Later, we handed them basic drawing programming cards like fill, location, size, and ellipse. Before handing a card to students, we asked their guesses on the function of the given card. In these activities,
            introducing a card’s function allowed us to discuss interdisciplinary subjects. For example, the fill card takes a single input that defines the hue value of the HSL color definition. After exploring different cards and seeing the effects
            of changing input values, we created our first program.
        </p>

    </div>

    <h3>User Study Findings</h3>


    <div class="section">
        <img class="doc" src="media/PhD_Qual_(27).jpg">
        <p>The survey results of physical studies and qualitative observations show that students enjoyed using Kart-ON, as seen in this table. Although the number of participants limits the analysis of results, the observers note that students kept their
            excitement through the studies. In addition, our screen time analysis revealed that in a one-hour study, active time spent on screens are varying between 5-10 minutes. This result indicates that we can effectively utilize a smartphone among
            6-12 groups of students in a classroom environment. Using Kart-ON support focusing on a given task and working with an AI tool help students to grasp the benefits and limitations of this new technology.
        </p>

    </div>

    <h3>Outline Summary</h3>


    <div class="section">
        <img class="doc" src="media/PhD_Qual_(28).jpg">
        <p>To summarize, our research started with a simple yet important question. We asked if we can develop a tangible programming environment that uses everyday materials as programming objects so that students can develop algorithmic thinking skills
            even in disadvantaged areas where students cannot access computers. To answer this question, we first developed Kart-ON, which uses paper programming cards and other everyday objects as programming blocks. In the meantime, we conducted some
            participatory design studies to explore the usability, material usage, and students’ interaction with AI. Parallel to our field study results, we also developed new helper tools for teachers and other developers. Once we developed a fundamental
            understanding of using simple materials as programming objects, we developed more challenging programming subjects such as data programming. In the final step, our goal was to increase the widespread impact of our programming environments.
            We did not discuss in this presentation, but we also conducted regular meetings with teachers to develop usable curricular materials.
        </p>

    </div>

    <h3>Next Steps: Long Term Impact</h3>


    <div class="section">
        <img class="doc" src="media/PhD_Qual_(29).jpg">
        <p>Collaborating with the Psychology Department, we will conduct semester-long classroom studies to understand children’s computational thinking, collaboration, and future technology motivation. We will work with at least 300 students. We will use
            the collected data to improve the technical capabilities of our applications. We will also integrate sketch and other modalities to improve the collaboration in the classroom environment.

        </p>

    </div>


    <h3>Next Steps: Student Engagement</h3>


    <div class="section">
        <img class="doc" src="media/PhD_Qual_(29).jpg">
        <p>Measuring student engagement is a fundamental aspect of learning assessment. In our user studies, we observed that using tangibles in learning design requires different metrics to measure engagement. Using facial features, child-tangible object
            interaction, group interaction and dialog data we can measure accurate student engagement.
